# color-game
This is a Color Game guessing! 
Read the color that is randomly given in RGB and try to guess what color is that!
There are two modes of difficulties.
The easy mode with only 3 squares - for those that are not so aware, or for those with no that much luck!
Also the difficult mode with 6 squares. 
If the colors are not the right for you, you can press on "NEW COLORS" and the colors will be randomly reset for you with new ones.
Once you find the correct color, you can press on "PLAY AGAIN?" for setting a new game, or just quit with the pleasure of the winner!
Have fun!
