This is a Color Game guessing! 
Read the color that is randomly given in RGB and try to guess the color. 
There are two modes of difficulty.
The easy mode with 3 squares and the difficult mode with 6 squares. 
If the color are not the right for you, you can press on "NEW COLORS" and the colors will be randomly reset for you with new ones.
Once you find the correct color, you can press on "PLAY AGAIN?" for setting a new game, or just quit with the pleasure of the winner!
